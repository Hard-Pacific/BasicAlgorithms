# BasicAlgorithms
 This repository contains implementations of various fundamental algorithms in Python. It's designed as a learning resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in understanding how these algorithms work under the hood.
 
## [Bubble sort](https://github.com/Hard-Pacific/BasicAlgorithms/tree/main/BubbleSort)
Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## [Insertation sort](https://github.com/Hard-Pacific/BasicAlgorithms/tree/main/InsertationSort)
Builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

## [Selection sort](https://github.com/Hard-Pacific/BasicAlgorithms/tree/main/SelectionSort)
Finds the minimum element in each iteration and places it at the beginning.
